# Deep Learning Specialization Course on Coursera
On this repository, I will post all my coding assignments from these courses.
This specialization consists of five courses that cover:
  - [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning?specialization=deep-learning) **[Completed]**
  - [Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization](https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-neural-network?specialization=deep-learning)
  - [Structuring Machine Learning Projects](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-projects?specialization=deep-learning)
  - [Convolutional Neural Networks](https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks?specialization=deep-learning)
  - [Sequence Models](https://www.coursera.org/learn/nlp-sequence-models)
